QLog (W.I.P)
---

### A customizable, multi-purpose tool for amateur radio operators.

Project goals:
  1. High-performance. QLog should be able to run on low-performance SOCs in portable operations, such as Raspberry Pis.
  2. Configurability and Modularity. QLog consists of tabs that can be added, moved, and resized however the operator likes.
  3. Reliable. QLog should be able to handle non-critical errors without crashing while alerting the user. Ideally, avoid errors in general.

Implemented features:
  1. Contact Logger
  2. Contact Viewer
  3. Callsign Lookup

Planned features:
  1. MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency) map
  2. DX Cluster information
  3. Solar information
  4. Frequency Allocation Chart for each license class
  5. Mode chart, ideally with images (To easily identify unknown signals via waterfall)
  6. PSKReporter map

Possible features:
  1. Ability to log contacts to LOTW, QRZ, and output a CSV file
  2. Logging to a remote server with a custom API
